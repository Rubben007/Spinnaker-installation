SPINNAKER INSTALLATION

You could install Spinnaker on Docker or Kubernetes but am going to be installing it on an Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS.
 
EC2/HALYARD SET:

1. first spin up the instance and ensure you install Java on it as Spinnaker is a java based application

2. since am using HALYARD to install spinnaker I will first have to install the hal directory by running this command "curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinnaker/halyard/master/install/debian/InstallHalyard.sh"

3. then run this command "sudo bash InstallHalyard.sh" to install Halyard.sh
	Check whether Halyard was installed properly:
	"hal -v"

        If this command fails, make sure hal is in your $PATH, and check the logs under /var/log/spinnaker/halyard/halyard.log.

4. Run ". ~/.bashrc" to enable command completion.

5. Run "hal config version edit --version 1.34.1" to configure the version of spinnaker
	You can change the version according to the version you want to work with

TO CONFIGURE AWS:

1. hal config provider aws edit --access-key-id $YOUR_SECRET_KEY_ID --secret-access-key

2. hal config provider aws account add $AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME --account-id ${ACCOUNT_ID} --assume-role role/spinnakerManaged

3. hal config provider aws account edit $AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME --regions us-east-1

4. hal config provider aws enable

SINCE WE HAVE NOTED ALL THE CREDENTIALS NEEDED ABOVE, WE WILL THEN SUPPLY THEM ACCORDINGLY 

FOR AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME: provide any name of your choice to the account because this is the managed account to Spinnaker.

5. after the above configuration, the configuration is stored in your /home/spinnaker/.hal/config depending on your current working directory so you can cat that directory and verify

WITH THIS, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CONFIGURED AWS WITH SPINNAKER. NEXT, WE WILL SET UP THE PERSISTENCE STORAGE SYSTEM USING S3 BUCKET
